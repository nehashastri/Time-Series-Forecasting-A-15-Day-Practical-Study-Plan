# Time-Series-Forecasting-A-7-Day-Practical-Study-Plan
I was unable to find a comprehensive resource that covers time series forecasting from the fundamentals through to model development and deployment. This repository aims to consolidate everything I have learned on the subject into one centralized, accessible location.

This 7-day guide will help you master modern time series forecasting with an implementation-focused approach. Each day covers specific topics, with code examples and real-world use cases. By the end, youâ€™ll know how to handle everything from basic concepts to deploying a live forecasting model.

> If I were in a hurry to learn, I would skip Day 4, 6 & 11
